This library was originally written for the Arduino framework, but it should be
easy to port. 

All hardware specific functionality is defined in definitions/ADS126X_hardware.h
To port, you just need to make functions for your board that perform those actions.

If you don't know what a function is supposed to do, look at the Arduino code.
The Arduino code is found in boards/arduino.cpp
